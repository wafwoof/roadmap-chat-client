### DISCLAIMER:

### Info:
Thank you for checking out this project! My goal is to experiment with a client/server Restful API Model in the form of a chat application.

Currently at least, the program is only half-operational. I am hoping to have the bare mimnium feature set done by christmas 2022.
### API Resources:
/chat, /chat/log, /chat/submit
